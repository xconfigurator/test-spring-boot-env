 * RestTemplate: The original Spring REST client with a synchronous, template method API.
 * WebClient: a non-blocking, reactive alternative that supports both synchronous and asynchronous as well as streaming scenarios.
 *
 * As of 5.0 the RestTemplate is in maintenance mode, with only minor requests for changes and bugs to be accepted going forward.
 * Please, consider using the WebClient which offers a more modern API and supports sync, async, and streaming scenarios.
